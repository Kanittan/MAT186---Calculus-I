### Overview
- Modeling Project
- Writing Task

\
**Modeling Project**\
• The goal of this paper is to deduce how a person should move to be the least wet under different conditions of rain type: Light Rain, Heavy Rain, and wind type: No wind, Tailwind, Headwind using the phycis of kinematics.\
• This paper makes use of mathematical equations, mathematical reasonings, Vector Diagrams, and Graphs to deduce the final conclusion.\
